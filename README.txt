 Now that the legalese preamble is out of the way, the description of the code
 and how to use it can begin!

 VevaciousPlusPlus is a program written fully in C++ to try to find all the
 minima of a loop-corrected potential and to calculate tunneling out of a
 desired symmetry-breaking minimum if this happens to be a false vacuum. It is
 designed to be used with model files which we recommend be generated by SARAH,
 a Mathematica package by Florian Staub, and utilizes the MINUIT algorithms by
 Fred James, and uses the Eigen C++ library for matrix inversion and eigenvalue
 calculation. Much of the tunneling code is based on the Python package
 CosmoTransitions, by Carroll (Max) Wainwright.
 
 VevaciousPlusPlus is an implementation of the process of attempting to find
 the minima of a quantum field theory potential with loop and thermal
 corrections, as decided upon by the collaboration of
 José Eliel Camargo Molina (elielx@gmail.com),
 Björn Garbrecht (garbrecht@tum.de),
 Ben O'Leary (benjamin.oleary@gmail.com),
 Werner Porod (porod@physik.uni-wuerzburg.de), and
 Florian Staub (florian.staub@googlemail.com). This README file was written by
 Ben O'Leary.
 
 A manual describing the physics and process of VevaciousPlusPlus will be
 available from http://arxiv.org/abs/????.???? and there will be a quickstart
 guide available from http://vevacious.hepforge.org/ following the appropriate
 link. A rough version of the installation instructions will be also contained
 in this README file, below the description of the process.

 Phase 1) Collect underpants
 Phase 2) ?
 Phase 3) Profit!
 Phase 4) Download and compile the LesHouchesParserClasses (LHPC) C++ library.
          The files are available at
          http://www.hepforge.org/downloads/lhpc
          (link last checked 2014-03-04) or
          https://github.com/benoleary/LesHouchesParserClasses_CPP
          (link last checked 2014-03-04). The installation should just be
          downloading, unzipping, and then running make. Version 0.8.7 or later
          is necessary!
 Phase 5) Download the Eigen header library, available from
          http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page#Download
          (link last checked 2014-02-25). No compilation is necessary.
 Phase 6) Compile VevaciousPlusPlus. The Makefile should be edited to have the
          correct paths to the header files and library file of LHPC (these are
          /path/to/unzipped/LHPC/include/ and /path/to/unzipped/LHPC/lib/ by
          default). LHPC version 0.8.7 or higher is required. The Makefile
          should also have the correct path to the header files from Eigen.


TODO:
 * Decent bundled model files
 * TakenPositive for PotentialFromPolynomialAndMasses
 * Implementing BasicPolynomialHomotopyContinuation class
 * Implementing MinuitBounceActionMinimizer class


CHANGELOG:
 * 9th May 2014: version 1.0.00.alpha.001
 - Seems to work on the test case.
 - Needs HOM4PS2 and CosmoTransitions (1 or 2).
 


The C++ files of VevaciousPlusPlus are:

 <> headers in VevaciousPlusPlus/include/:
 *.hpp

 <> source files in VevaciousPlusPlus/source/:
 *.cpp

 <> and also:
 VevaciousPlusPlus/Makefile
 and README.VevaciousPlusPlus.txt
 which describes the package (copied as README.txt).
 The makefile creates a single executable in VevaciousPlusPlus/bin/:
 VevaciousPlusPlus.exe, the executable which performs the full set of steps to
 try to find the minima of the loop- and thermal-corrected potential and
 tunneling out of the DSB minimum if it is a false vacuum.
 
 <> Some example files are also given:
 * VevaciousPlusPlus/bin/VevaciousPlusPlusInitialization.xml which is a default
   initialization file, which uses paths that need to be changed.
 * Various files in VevaciousPlusPlus/ModelFiles/, with the extension .vin,
   which specify various models.
