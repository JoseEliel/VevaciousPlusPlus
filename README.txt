 Now that the legalese preamble is out of the way, the description of the code
 and how to use it can begin!

REQUIRES LesHouchesParserClasses (LHPC) version 0.8.12 or later!

 VevaciousPlusPlus is a program written fully in C++ to try to find all the
 minima of a loop-corrected potential and to calculate tunneling out of a
 desired symmetry-breaking minimum if this happens to be a false vacuum. It is
 designed to be used with model files which we recommend be generated by SARAH,
 a Mathematica package by Florian Staub, and utilizes the MINUIT algorithms by
 Fred James, and uses the Eigen C++ library for matrix inversion and eigenvalue
 calculation. Much of the tunneling code is based on the Python package
 CosmoTransitions, by Carroll (Max) Wainwright.
 
 VevaciousPlusPlus is an implementation of the process of attempting to find
 the minima of a quantum field theory potential with loop and thermal
 corrections, as decided upon by the collaboration of
 José Eliel Camargo-Molina (elielcamargomolina@gmail.com),
 Björn Garbrecht (garbrecht@tum.de),
 Ben O'Leary (benjamin.oleary@gmail.com),
 Werner Porod (porod@physik.uni-wuerzburg.de), and
 Florian Staub (florian.staub@googlemail.com). This README file was written by
 Ben O'Leary and  José Eliel Camargo-Molina.
 
 A manual describing the physics and process of VevaciousPlusPlus will be
 available from http://arxiv.org/abs/????.???? and there will be a quickstart
 guide available from http://vevacious.hepforge.org/ following the appropriate
 link.

The C++ files of VevaciousPlusPlus are:

 <> headers in VevaciousPlusPlus/include/:
 *.hpp

 <> source files in VevaciousPlusPlus/source/:
 *.cpp

 <> and also:
 VevaciousPlusPlus/Makefile
 and README.VevaciousPlusPlus.txt
 which describes the package (copied as README.txt).
 The makefile creates a single executable in VevaciousPlusPlus/bin/:
 VevaciousPlusPlus.exe, the executable which performs the full set of steps to
 try to find the minima of the loop- and thermal-corrected potential and
 tunneling out of the DSB minimum if it is a false vacuum.
 
 <> Some example files are also given:
 * VevaciousPlusPlus/bin/VevaciousPlusPlusInitialization.xml which is a default
   initialization file, which uses paths that need to be changed.
 * Various files in VevaciousPlusPlus/ModelFiles/, with the extension .vin,
   which specify various models.
