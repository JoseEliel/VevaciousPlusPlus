   <!-- Either "true"/"yes" or "false"/"no" (case-insensitive): if
                 true then the starting points for gradient-based minimization
                 are only the subset of solutions which also are minima of the
                 polynomial function (so discarding maxima and saddle points).
                 This should only be used with caution: it could be, for
                 example, that the panic vacuum at the one-loop level is near a
                 tree-level saddle point rather than near a tree-level minimum,
                 and if such a saddle point is discarded rather than used as a
                 starting point for the minimization of the one-loop potential,
                 the panic vacuum might be missed. (It is debatable whether a
                 potential where the loop expansion turns a tree-level saddle
                 point into a one-loop-level minimum can be trusted as a loop
                 expansion, but Vevacious allows it.) The advantage of
                 discarding the saddle points and maxima of the polynomial is
                 that if you are sure that it will not lead to important vacua
                 being missed, it will speed up the subsequent gradient-based
                 minimization by reducing the number of points to minimize, but
                 under usual circumstances, it is the tunneling calculation
                 which is the bottleneck. -->

             the DSB minimum at 1-loop level could grow so large that it would
