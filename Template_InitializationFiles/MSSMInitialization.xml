<!-- Quick start: if you just want to change the model (i.e. the potential in
     terms of a set of fields), change it in the file given by
     <PotentialFunctionInitializationFile>. Everything else is for tweaking the
     way in which the vacua are found, such as the initial step sizes of
     gradient-based minimization, or how the (meta)stability is calculated,
     such as the resolution of the tunneling path, or whether thermal tunneling
     is skipped, and so on. -->
