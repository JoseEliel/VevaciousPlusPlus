          <ReturnOnlyPolynomialMinima>
            <!-- Either "true"/"yes" or "false"/"no" (case-insensitive): if
                 true then the starting points for gradient-based minimization
                 are only the subset of solutions which also are minima of the
                 polynomial function (so discarding maxima and saddle points).
                 This should only be used with caution: it could be, for
                 example, that the panic vacuum at the one-loop level is near a
                 tree-level saddle point rather than near a tree-level minimum,
                 and if such a saddle point is discarded rather than used as a
                 starting point for the minimization of the one-loop potential,
                 the panic vacuum might be missed. (It is debatable whether a
                 potential where the loop expansion turns a tree-level saddle
                 point into a one-loop-level minimum can be trusted as a loop
                 expansion, but Vevacious allows it.) The advantage of
                 discarding the saddle points and maxima of the polynomial is
                 that if you are sure that it will not lead to important vacua
                 being missed, it will speed up the subsequent gradient-based
                 minimization by reducing the number of points to minimize, but
                 under usual circumstances, it is the tunneling calculation
                 which is the bottleneck. -->

             basins of attraction: we discovered in explorations with
             Vevacious 1 that it could happen that the basin of attraction of
             the DSB minimum at 1-loop level could grow so large that it would
             encompass tree-level minima that belong in some sense to other
             1-loop minima, which moved very far away due to loop corrections,
             so even though their basins of attraction also grew very large in
             the same way that of the DSB minimum did, they moved enough that
             "their" tree-level minima were left out. If a starting point is
             sufficiently far away from the DSB minimum yet rolls there under
             gradient-based minimization, the starting point's field values are
             scaled up by the number given by this element, and used as a new
             starting point. If not given, 4.0 is taken as the default. -->
