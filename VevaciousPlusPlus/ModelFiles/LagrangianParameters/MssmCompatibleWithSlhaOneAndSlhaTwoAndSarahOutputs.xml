  <RenormalizationScaleChoices>
    <!-- Vevacious needs to be able to decide what scale to use for a
         fixed-scale calculation if given a potential function which uses just
         a single scale in its evaluation, and Vevacious also needs to be able
         to put a lower bound on the renormalization scale used if given a
         potential function which evaluates the Lagrangian parameters at
         different renormalization scales, so as to avoid issues with taking
         logarithms of zero and also, pertinent to this kind of Lagrangian
         parameter management (through an instance of the
         LesHouchesAccordBlockEntryManager class or a class derived from it),
         to avoid extrapolating parameters far away from the values given in
         the LHA file.

         The fixed-scale element is called FixedScaleChoice and the
         minimum-scale element is called MinimumScaleBound.

         Each element consists of two child elements: EvaluationType and
         EvaluationArgument.

         EvaluationType can be "FixedNumber", in which case
         EvaluationArgument should be a fixed number, e.g.
      <EvaluationType>
        FixedNumber
      </EvaluationType>
      <EvaluationArgument>
        91.1876
      </EvaluationArgument>
         would use the central value of the Z mass given by the Particle Data
         Group live listings on 2015-11-05.

         EvaluationType can be "BlockLowestScale", in which case
         EvaluationArgument should be the name of a block which will be read in
         the parameter point's LHA file, and the lowest scale explicitly given
         for that block will be used, e.g.
      <EvaluationType>
        BlockLowestScale
      </EvaluationType>
      <EvaluationArgument>
        GAUGE
      </EvaluationArgument>
         would use the value given after "GAUGE Q=" in the LHA file.

         EvaluationType can be "BlockEntry", in which case
         EvaluationArgument should be the name of a block which will be read in
         the parameter point's LHA file followed by an index or set of indices
         in square brackets, and the value in that block (the copy of the block
         in the file with the lowest scale if multiple blocks of the same name
         are in a single file) with that index or those indices will be used,
         e.g.
      <EvaluationType>
        BlockEntry
      </EvaluationType>
      <EvaluationArgument>
        SMINPUTS[4]
      </EvaluationArgument>
         would use the value given with index 4 in the SMINPUTS block in the
         LHA file (which is the input Z mass), while
      <EvaluationArgument>
        MSU2[3,3]
      </EvaluationArgument>
         would use the value with indices (3, 3) in the MSU2 block (which is
         the (3, 3) entry in the soft SUSY-breaking up-type squark mass-squared
         matrix).

         Finally, EvaluationType can be "SqrtAbs", in which case
         EvaluationArgument should be the same as for "BlockEntry", but in this
         case the square root of the absolute value of the entry will be used,
         e.g.
      <EvaluationType>
        SqrtAbs
      </EvaluationType>
      <EvaluationArgument>
        MSOFT[22]
      </EvaluationArgument>
         would use the square root of the absolute value of the value given
         with index 22 in the MSOFT block in the LHA file (which is the soft
         SUSY-breaking mass-squared parameter for Hu, which is often
         negative). -->

      <EvaluationArgument>

  <SpecialCases>
    <!-- This tells Vevacious to prepare certain special cases because there
         are certain values which are not printed directly in blocks according
         to the offical SUSY Les Houches Accords standard.

         The setting SarahMssm tells Vevacious to set up a parameter manager
         which understands keywords specific to output from the SPhenoMSSM 
         produced by SARAH and also the keywords specific to using output
         conforming to the SLHA1 and SLHA2 standards.

         The SLHA1/2 keywords:
         * DsbVd, DsbVu: the VEVs for Hd and Hu respectively at the SM-like
           vacuum, because only v = sqrt(vd^2 + vu^2) and tan(beta) = vu/vd
           are printed in HMIX.
         * Bmu (m3Sq is an alternative alias): the bilinear soft SUSY-breaking
           parameter, of dimension mass^2, coupling the Hd and Hu scalar
           fields, because only mA^2 = ( Bmu / (sin(beta) * cos(beta) ) and
           tan(beta) are given in HMIX.
         * Te11, Te22, Te33, Td11, Td22, Td33, Tu11, Tu22, Tu33: the diagonal
           entries of the trilinear soft SUSY-breaking terms corresponding to
           TE[1,1] etc. in the official SLHA2 standard. Unfortunately, SLHA1
           output only prints the diagonal A terms, which have to be multiplied
           with the Yukawa couplings to get the actual trilinear couplings (of
           dimension mass^1) in the Lagrangian. Hence to accept both SLHA1 and
           SLHA2 output, Te11 has to be a special case, checking for the TE
           block first, then if necessary checking for AE and YE and
           multiplying the values, and so on.
         * TE[1,1] and so on are also set to be special case aliases of the
           above, rather than looked for directly.
         * Msl211, Msl222, Msl233, Mse211, Mse222, Mse233, Msq211, Msq222,
           Msq233, Msu211, Msu222, Msu233, Msd211, Msd222, Msd233: the diagonal
           soft SUSY-breaking mass-squared terms for the sfermions
           corresponding to MSL2[1,1] and so on in the official SLHA2 standard.
           Unfortunately, SLHA1 output only prints the positive square roots of
           these Lagrangian parameters, in various entries in MSOFT. Hence to
           accept both SLHA1 and SLHA2 output, Msl211 has to be a special case,
           checking for the MSL2 block first, then if necessary checking for
           MSOFT[31] and squaring it, and so on.
         * MSL2[1,1] and so on are also set to be special case aliases of the
           above, rather than looked for directly.

         The SARAH keywords:
         * DsbVd, DsbVu: the same as DsbVd and DsbVu above, except first
           looking for their values directly in HMIX[102] and HMIX[103]
           respectively.
         * Bmu: the same as Bmu above, except first looking for its value in
           HMIX[101].
         * muTree, BmuTree, mHdSqTree, mHuSqTree: these are the tree-level
           values of mu, Bmu, m^2_Hd, m^2_Hu respectively in the
           Liebler-Porod-Staub scheme printed by SARAH-generated SPheno (where
           the SM-like vacuum VEVs are constant at every loop order), taking
           the values in TREEHMIX[1], TREEHMIX[101], TREEMSOFT[21],
           TREEMSOFT[22] respectively first, defaulting to the values in the
           blocks without TREE prepended if the TREE-prepended values are
           absent.
         * muLoop, BmuLoop, mHdSqLoop, mHuSqLoop: these are the 1-loop-level
           values of the above, taking the values in LOOPHMIX[1] etc. first.
         
         The other valid values for this element provided in Vevacious 2.0.00
         are SlhaMssm, to have only the SLHA1/2 keywords, or nothing at all,
         so that no keywords are used at all, in which case the potential
         object should only ever ask the parameter manager object for values
         printed directly in LHA blocks found in the parameter point file. -->

  <!-- Every block that will be read in from a file in the (SUSY) Les Houches
       Accords format should be enumerated here, separated by whitespace -
       i.e. spaces, tabs, newlines. Also permitted for readability are commas
       and semicolons, as valid block names should just be single strings of
       alphanumeric characters. Block names are NOT case-sensitive (following
       the SLHA conventions). Any blocks not explicitly mentioned here will be
       considered invalid requests when the potential function object requests
       values from the parameter manager object!
       N.B.: Only a subset of possible LHA-style blocks are permitted: those
       where each line is of the form of a set of integer indices followed by a
       single floating-point number. The number of indices is not limited.
       For a block named BLAH, the elements are referred to as BLAH[ 1 ] or
       BLAH[ 2, 3 ] or BLAH[4,5,6] and so on for blocks with 1, 2 or 3 indices
       respectively and so on. Also, blocks which are just a single line with
       a single floating-point number are permitted, but must be referred to
       with empty square brackets: BLAH[] (e.g. the ALPHA block of the
       original SUSY Les Houches Accords). -->
