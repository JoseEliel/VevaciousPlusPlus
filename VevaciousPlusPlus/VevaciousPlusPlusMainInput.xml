<!-- Quick start:
     This file is intended to provide the choice of potential and the parameter
     point or points to be run. It has 2 types of element.

     1) The <InitializationFile> element gives a file
        name which is used for creating the code objects which play the role of
        the potential and Lagrangian parameters, and the objects which solve
        the system.

     2) There are 2 types of parameter-point-defining element. The primary type
        is <SingleParameterPoint>, which defines a single point. The secondary
        type is <ParameterPointSet>, which gives a folder where a set of
        parameter-point-defining files should be.
        2a) By default, the content of a <SingleParameterPoint> element is
            passed to the RunPoint(...) function of the VevaciousPlusPlus
            object, which by default assumes that this is the name of a file
            which contains Lagrangian parameter values in the (SUSY) Les
            Houches Accord ((S)LHA) format. Multiple <SingleParameterPoint>
            elements can be given here, and each of them will be run in turn.
        2b) A <ParameterPointSet> element must contain 2 elements:
            <InputFolder>, which gives the path of a folder which contains
            files which will be run through RunPoint(...) as (S)LHA files, and
            optionally <OutputFolder>, which will be used as a destination for
            output files. If <OutputFolder> is not given, output files will be
            placed in the folder given by <InputFolder>.
            Every file in the folder given by <InputFolder> will be taken as
            input, but no subdirectories will be entered.
            A primitive locking system is used to allow multiple computers to
            use a shared folder to work through all the files in parallel: each
            process looks for an input file in the input folder which does not
            have its corresponding output file (which will have the same name
            with ".vout" appended) or a corresponding "placeholder" file (which
            has the same name but with ".placeholder" appended). When it finds
            such an input file, it creates an empty "placeholder" file, and
            then proceeds to run the point, then when it is finished, it writes
            the output file and then deletes the placeholder, and moves on to
            look for the next input file. Multiple <ParameterPointSet>
            elements can be given here, and each of them will be run in turn.
            
         Multiple <SingleParameterPoint> elements and <ParameterPointSet>
         elements can be given in this file, and they will be run in the order
         in which they appear, though the "placeholder" files are only created
         for files in input folders given by <ParameterPointSet> elements. -->



  <!-- The <InitializationFile> element is required for setting up the
       VevaciousPlusPlus object. It should be the name of an XML file which
       contains all the information required to assemble the VevaciousPlusPlus
       object. An example is provided:
       InitializationFiles/VevaciousPlusPlusDefaultObjectInitialization.xml
       which has comments describing each of the elements. Its main purpose is
       do define the model to be used (potential function, source of Lagrangian
       parameters) and choices of technical details for the calculation, all
       through names of further files containing the information. -->
  <InitializationFile>
    /home/bol/BOL/VevaciousPlusPlusTesting/InitializationFiles/VevaciousPlusPlusDefaultObjectInitialization.xml
  </InitializationFile>
  
  <!-- By default, the content of this element is assumed to be the name of a
       file in (S)LHA format, and the output will be written in 2 places:
       appended to the end of the (S)LHA file in several blocks
       (VEVACIOUSSTABILITY, VEVACIOUSZEROTEMPERATURE,
       VEVACIOUSNONZEROTEMPERATURE, VEVACIOUSFIELDNAMES, VEVACIOUSDSBVACUUM,
       and VEVACIOUSPANICVACUUM);
       and as a separate XML file, which has the same name as the input file
       with ".vout" appended (e.g. for "InputExample.lha", the output will be
       written in "InputExample.lha.vout"). -->
